<span class="i0">Of that divine disastrous place<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where Life was slain and Truth was slandered<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On that one holier hill than Rome,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The mystic city many-gated,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With monstrous columns, was your own:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Herodian stones fell down and waited<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two thousand years to be your throne.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the grey rocks the burning blossom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glowed terrible as the sacred blood:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was no stranger to your bosom<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than bluebells of an English wood.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Do you remember a road that follows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The way of unforgotten feet,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And the jackal barking in the night?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Life is not void or stuff for scorners:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We have laughed loud and kept our love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We have heard singers in tavern corners<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And not forgotten the birds above:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We have known smiters and sons of thunder<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And not unworthily walked with them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We have grown wiser and lost not wonder;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we have seen Jerusalem.<br /></span>
